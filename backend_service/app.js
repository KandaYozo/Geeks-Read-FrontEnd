I also think that Mellisa de la Cruz dragged out the begining a bit too long. I started to lose intrest until I finally got farther in. Other than those two things I disagree with u. So first of all I happen to love the name schyler. And the fact that shes gothic and pretty is not a thing we see often. Usually its a girl that everyone likes (twilight) or the popular girl ( vampire diaries) no one even notices her until shes identified as a blue blood. The story was a refreshing take on vampires. Ive read all four books and the story really develops into something a lot more satisfying.'

He apprenticed with a printer. He also worked as a typesetter and contributed articles to his older brother Orion\'s newspaper. After toiling as a printer in various cities, he became a master riverboat pilot on the Mississippi River, before heading west to join Orion. He was a failure at gold mining, so he next turned to journalism. While a reporter, he wrote a humorous story, "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County," which proved to be very popular and brought him nationwide attention. His travelogues were also well-received. Twain had found his calling.',
